# generator-full-separated-angular-spring [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]
> A full separated project that features AngularJS as frontend framework and Spring as Java backend framework

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-full-separated-angular-spring using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-full-separated-angular-spring
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo full-separated-angular-spring
```

## Getting To The full separated generator

This generator is made to be used in an enviroment where you decide to keep perfectly separated the frontend from the backend.
The project is newborn and is subject to extreme changes. By the way everything is published is always valuable to the user.
By now the generator creates a spring-based java structure and an angularjs project both connected with maven. A parent pom is generated and two connected poms are linked to it.

This readme will be updated soon. By now I am focusing on the code
